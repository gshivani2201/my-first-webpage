                <h2>Built from scratch through SCRIMBA</h2>
                <p>I have no coding background. I could not even read the code properly. Then I came to know about a course on <em>Scrimba</em>a which is <strong>"HTML and CSS crash course"</strong> by <em>Kevin Powell</em>.</p>
                <p>His teaching skill is incredible. I completed the course in just <em>5 days</em> and created this whole webpage with everything I have learnt in that course.</p>
                <p>Unbelievable? For me too!</p>
                <p>This webpage is <em>my first</em> ever project and also a gesture of gratitude towards Scrimba for it's incredible course.</p>
